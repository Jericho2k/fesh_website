        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and Fesh (“we”, “us”, “our”) governing your access to and use of the Fesh mobile application, website, and any related services (collectively, the “Service”). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>Fesh is a fashion discovery and wardrobe app. It allows you to browse and save fashion items, manage your wardrobe, create and share outfit ideas (“fits”), use AI-assisted outfit suggestions, follow other users, and subscribe to Fesh Pro for additional features. The Service is provided “as is” and we may change, suspend, or discontinue features at any time.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility and Account</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction to consent to use the Service) to use Fesh. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account. You must provide accurate information and update it when it changes. You may not share your account or allow others to access it.</p>

        <h2>3. User Content and Conduct</h2>
        <p>You may post content (photos, text, outfit ideas, and other materials) through the Service (“User Content”). You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable license to use, store, display, and process your User Content as needed to operate, improve, and promote the Service.</p>
        <p>You agree that your User Content and your use of the Service will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violate any law or infringe any third-party rights (including intellectual property or privacy);</li>
            <li>Be defamatory, harassing, hateful, or discriminatory;</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation;</li>
            <li>Include malware, spam, or unauthorized advertising;</li>
            <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent the Service’s security, access controls, or usage limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may remove User Content or suspend or terminate your account if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law. We are not obligated to monitor User Content but may do so.</p>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service in any way that could harm, disable, or overburden our systems or networks;</li>
            <li>Scrape, crawl, or use automated means to access the Service without our permission;</li>
            <li>Resell or commercially exploit the Service or any data obtained through it (except as expressly allowed by the Service);</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the Service (except where permitted by law).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments (Fesh Pro)</h2>
        <p>Some features are available only through a paid subscription (“Fesh Pro”). Subscription terms, pricing, and billing are presented at the time of purchase. Payments are processed by the applicable app store (e.g. Apple App Store, Google Play) or other payment provider we designate. Your subscription may auto-renew unless you cancel before the end of the current period. Refunds are subject to the policies of the app store or payment provider; we do not control their refund decisions.</p>
        <p>We may change subscription fees or features with reasonable notice. Continued use after a fee change constitutes acceptance. We may discontinue Fesh Pro or specific plans with notice and, where required, pro-rata refunds.</p>

        <h2>6. AI and Third-Party Features</h2>
        <p>Parts of the Service use artificial intelligence (e.g. for outfit suggestions or content descriptions). AI outputs are for convenience only and may be inaccurate or unsuitable. You use them at your own risk. We do not guarantee that AI-generated suggestions reflect your preferences or that they are appropriate for any particular use.</p>
        <p>The Service may integrate or link to third-party services (e.g. authentication, analytics, payment). Your use of those services is subject to their terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services or their availability, accuracy, or practices.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Fesh and its logos, design, and software are owned by us or our licensors. These Terms do not grant you any right to use our trademarks, branding, or other intellectual property except as necessary to use the Service in the normal way. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Service or use our branding without prior written permission.</p>

        <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our collection and use of personal information is described in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the Service, you consent to that processing. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY CONTENT OR AI OUTPUTS.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FESH AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OR (B) ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (USD 100). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fesh and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your use of the Service, (b) your User Content, (c) your violation of these Terms or any law, or (d) your violation of any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service, with or without notice, for any reason, including if we believe you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases. Sections that by their nature should survive (including disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law) will survive termination.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on this page and update the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we may also notify you via the app or email where possible. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>

        <h2>14. General</h2>
        <p><strong>Governing law:</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
        <p><strong>Disputes:</strong> Any dispute arising from these Terms or the Service will be resolved in the courts located in Delaware, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.</p>
        <p><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other policies we reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Fesh regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements.</p>
        <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
